Open to collaborating on beginner-friendly data analytics projects
---
Hello world! I'm currently looking for opportunities to collaborate on data analytics projects, contribute to open-source work, or support real-world initiatives in need of an enthusiastic and growing data analyst.

**👨‍💻 About Me**

I'm a semi-beginner data analyst with hands-on experience across SQL, Power BI, Excel, and large datasets. I’m especially passionate about finding stories in data and bringing them to life through clear dashboards and insights.

**🔍 Experience**

Financial Crime Analytics (2-month project)
Analyzed fraudulent activity patterns in a large transactional dataset. Explored suspicious behavior using Excel and SQL, and provided early-stage insights for risk triggers.

Overdraft Account Solution – Lloyds Tech Event
Participated in a short collaborative project focusing on improving customer experience around overdraft accounts.

Academic Research Projects (Quantitative + Qualitative)
• Conducted a quantitative study on management behavior, collecting and analyzing survey data using Excel and SPSS
• Completed a qualitative research project on entrepreneurship, applying interview analysis to explore key behavioral patterns

Ad-hoc Querying & Dashboarding
Worked with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to extract insights for sample business scenarios.
Built dashboards in Power BI and Excel to visualize trends, segment customers, and simulate business KPIs.

**💡 Skills**

📊 Power BI: DAX measures, interactive dashboards

📈 Excel: PivotTables, business model forecasts, dashboard design, data cleaning and querying

🧠 SQL (SSMS): Writing queries, filtering large datasets

📚 Keen to learn: Python (pandas), real-world business analytics, and cloud-based tools


**🤝 What I'm Looking For**

Real or mock projects that allow me to analyze, visualize, and communicate data

Volunteer projects or open-source collaborations (e.g. social good, fintech, business ops)

Mentorship from mid-to-senior analysts or data scientists

Feedback on past work or code reviews to improve my practice
